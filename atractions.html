                    <h2>The Pyramids</h2>
                    <p>
                        Built during a time when Egypt was one of the richest and most powerful civilizations in the world,
                        the pyramids—especially the Great Pyramids of Giza—are some of the most magnificent man-made structures in history.
                        Their massive scale reflects the unique role that the pharaoh, or king, played in ancient Egyptian society.
                        Though pyramids were built from the beginning of the Old Kingdom to the close of the Ptolemaic period in the fourth century A.D.,
                        the peak of pyramid building began with the late third dynasty and continued until roughly the sixth (c. 2325 B.C.).
                        More than 4,000 years later, the Egyptian pyramids still retain much of their majesty, providing a glimpse into the country’s rich and glorious past.

                    <h2>Luxor Temple</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Luxor Temple is a large Ancient Egyptian temple complex located on the east bank of the Nile River in the city today known as Luxor (ancient Thebes) and was constructed approximately 1400 BCE.
                        In the Egyptian language it was known as ipet resyt, "the southern sanctuary". It was one of the two primary temples on the east bank, the other being Karnak. Unlike the other temples in Thebes,
                        Luxor temple is not dedicated to a cult god or a deified version of the pharaoh in death. Instead, Luxor temple is dedicated to the rejuvenation of kingship; it may have been where many of the pharaohs
                        of Egypt were crowned in reality or conceptually (as in the case of Alexander the Great, who claimed he was crowned at Luxor but may never have traveled south of Memphis, near modern Cairo).
